# IEEE-Micromouse
Designed in STM Cube IDE as part of UCLA IEEE Micromouse 2020-2021

The UCLA IEEE Micromouse Project provides students with the opportunity to design and build a small autonomous robot to traverse a 16x16 maze. 
This multifaceted embedded systems project allows members to learn and apply knowledge in microcontroller programming, algorithm analysis, signal processing, feedback control, circuit design, and more. 
Students design and development their robots to prepare for competitions in the spring. (Pulled from old IEEE Website)
